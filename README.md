# Muse - Project README

Muse is a website dedicated to raising awareness about the growing impact of AI on human-created art. The platform highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the ongoing shift as technology continues to shape and influence the creative industries. By providing tools and features that promote discussion and exploration, Muse encourages a deeper dialogue on the intersection of AI and traditional artistry.
